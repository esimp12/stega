- [ ] Create core container with API adapter that creates new portfolio


NOTES:

Next things to do and consider:

1) Add all of the portfolio CRUD operations to the API adapter.
2) Add README.md files to each service and update the main README.md with instructions on how to run the project, including how to use the invoke commands.
